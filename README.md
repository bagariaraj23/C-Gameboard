# C-Gameboard

Our project is basically an INTEGRATION of different types of games. We were able to write separate codes for separate games. But the main challenge was to integrate all the games in one single code so as to create a complete “Game Board”. We used switch case to integrate all the codes into one.

Following games are included in our program -

TIC TAC TOE :
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

FLAMES :
FLAMES is a popular game named after the acronym: Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, Sibling. This game does not accurately predict whether or not an individual is right for you, but it can be fun to play this with your friends.

VIRTUAL CHARADES :
Dumb Charades is one of the most famous party games of all times. The most difficult part in this game is not acting, but coming up with movies for the opposite team. We make the problem easier by providing the players with movie names which the other teams can enact.

Snakes :
It is considered to have signalled a new era in mobile gaming. A snake targets its food and grows linearly and when it touches it’s body or the boundary walls, the snake dies and the game ends
